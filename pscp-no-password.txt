PSCP Without Entering A Password
Most office enviroments you have a mixture of windows and linux servers. I have covered how to scp files without a password before for linux, heres how to scp from a windows box to a linux box without a password using key files

On the Windows download pscp and puttygen at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Start puttygen, click generate, randomly move your mouse over blank area to generate public/private key pair.
The key pair is generated is displayed in the text areain puttygen. Save the file private-key as “private-key.ppk”, and public-key file as “public-key″
Upload “public-key″ to ~/.ssh folder on the linux box. Then run the following commands to convert the key to linux format then import the key into your authorized keys file.

ssh-keygen -i -f ~/.ssh/my-public-key > ~/.ssh/user-public-key.pub
cat ~/.ssh/user-public-key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now on the windows box you can SCP without a password as long as you specify the private key file, using this format
pscp.exe -i YOURPRIVATEKEYFILE.ppk c:\FILE_TO_UPLOAD USER@HOST:/DESTINATION_FOLDER/

pscp -i %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Linux\private-key.ppk %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Perl\CPDB1\monitor_db_tlog_size.pl sybase@CPSYBTEST:/opt/sap/cron_scripts
pscp -i %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Linux\private-key.ppk %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Perl\CPDB1\monitor_db_tlog_size.pl sybase@CPDB4:/opt/sap/cron_scripts
pscp -i %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Linux\private-key.ppk %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Perl\CPDB1\monitor_db_tlog_size.pl sybase@CPDB2:/opt/sap/cron_scripts
pscp -i %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Linux\private-key.ppk %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Perl\CPDB1\monitor_db_tlog_size.pl sybase@CPDB1:/opt/sap/cron_scripts
pscp -i %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\Linux\private-key.ppk %dropbox%\DBA\ScriptWH\IQ\data-integration\eng_temp.csv sybase@CPIQ:/opt/sybase/bcp_data

ssh-keygen -i -f ~/.ssh/public-key > ~/.ssh/user-public-key.pub
cat ~/.ssh/user-public-key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
